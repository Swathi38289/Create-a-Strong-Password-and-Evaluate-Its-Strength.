## Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

---

## 🎯 Objective
To understand what makes a password strong, evaluate different passwords using an online password strength checker, and analyze how complexity affects security.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Online Password Strength Checker (Example: https://passwordmeter.com)
- Web Browser

---

## 🧪 Passwords Created and Tested

| Password | Complexity Level | Strength Result | Remarks |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| swathi123 | Weak | Low | Common name + numbers |
| Swathi123 | Moderate | Medium | Added uppercase |
| Sw@thi123 | Strong | High | Added special character |
| Swa@thi#2026! | Very Strong | Very High | Increased length + symbols |
| Quantum!River#82Sky | Extremely Strong | Excellent | Long passphrase-style password |

---

## 📊 Evaluation Results

### 1️⃣ swathi123
- Too short  
- Contains common word  
- Easily guessable  
- Vulnerable to dictionary attacks  

### 2️⃣ Sw@thi123
- Better character mix  
- Still predictable base word  
- Moderate protection  

### 3️⃣ Swa@thi#2026!
- Good length  
- Strong character diversity  
- More resistant to brute force  

### 4️⃣ Quantum!River#82Sky
- Long length  
- No predictable pattern  
- Very high entropy  
- Highly resistant to brute force attacks

## 🔍 Key Concepts Learned

### 🔐 What Makes a Password Strong?
- Minimum 12–16 characters  
- Combination of uppercase and lowercase letters  
- Includes numbers and special characters  
- Avoids personal information  
- Avoids common dictionary words  
- Random and unpredictable  

---

## 🚨 Common Password Attacks

### 1. Brute Force Attack
Trying every possible combination until the correct password is found.

### 2. Dictionary Attack
Using a list of common passwords and words to guess the password.

### 3. Credential Stuffing
Using leaked passwords from one site to access other accounts.

### 4. Phishing
Tricking users into revealing their passwords.

## 📏 Why Password Length Matters

Password length increases:
- Total possible combinations  
- Time required to crack the password  
- Overall entropy (randomness)  

Long passwords are significantly harder to break than short complex ones.

---

## 🔑 What is a Passphrase?

A passphrase is a long sentence-like password that is:
- Easier to remember  
- Harder to crack  

Example:
BlueTiger!RunsAcross7Mountains  

---

## 🔐 What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?

MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring:
- Something you know (password)  
- Something you have (OTP / mobile device)  
- Something you are (biometrics)  

Even if a password is compromised, MFA protects the account.

---

## ❌ Common Password Mistakes

- Using name + birthdate  
- Using simple passwords like 123456  
- Reusing the same password everywhere  
- Using short passwords  
- Storing passwords insecurely  

---

## 📌 Conclusion

Password strength depends mainly on:
- Length  
- Randomness  
- Character variety  
- Unpredictability  

Long passphrases provide better security compared to short complex passwords.

This task helped me understand:
- How password attacks work  
- The importance of entropy  
- Why password managers and MFA are essential  
- Best practices for creating strong passwords
